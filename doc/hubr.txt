INTRODUCTION                                                 *hubr-introduction*

*hubr* is a set of super simple GitHub tools for fun, productivity, and Vim


==============================================================================
UNITE SOURCES                                               *hubr-unite-sources*

hubr provides some new "sources" for Unite.vim

                                                    *hubr-unite-source-gh_issue*
gh_issue    Nominates GitHub issues for the current repo as candidates.
        Arguments can be provided in any order, and must be in the form
        `key=val` or `key?`. The keys are exactly the arguments to be passed
        to the `hubr#get_issues()` method. 
        The `key=val` syntax is self-explanatory.
        The `key?` syntax is used to indicate that hubr should look for the
        value in the `hubrrc` file (which, as you may remember, can be placed
        in the project root to override global settings).


==============================================================================
UNITE KINDS                                                   *hubr-unite-kinds*

hubr provides some new "kinds" for Unite.vim

                                                      *hubr-unite-kind-gh_issue*
gh_issue    A kind for GitHub issues.
